                <p id="pr1" class="paragraph">Throughout this program and my journey as a computer scientist, I have analyzed, planned, and developed a wide plethora of software to hone my skills in being a software developer. With the courses I have taken, I have learned and improved upon my skills in various categories: team collaboration, communicating with stakeholders, data structures/algorithms, databases, and security. I have learned and demonstrated my skills in collaborating in a team environment when completing a course about the scrum-agile development process, where I got to play the roles of different members in a team to design and develop a project based off of a client’s expectations. For each role, I built on work done by another team member, and properly documented the work I did to allow for the next team member to understand what I did so the project could be further build upon. To hone my skills in communicating with stakeholders, I completed a course about using interviewing and interpreting the expectations set out by a client that wanted an application to be developed to create a cohesive and detailed business requirement document. This business requirement document required the analysis of multiple stakeholder interviews along with appropriate questions and follow up interviews to be made to ensure that all of the requirements for the application were what the stakeholders expected and were feasible to be developed. For data structures and algorithms, I honed these skills through a course were a large file of over 10,000 songs (lyrics included) needed to be organized and filtered to allow for songs to be sorted through and searched for based various parameters, such as song title or a given portion of a song’s lyrics. To allow for the organization of these songs, data structures were created to house each song as its own object and various common and uncommon sorting and searching algorithms were developed and tested with time complexities being recorded to find the best sorting algorithms that very efficiently sorted/searched through the large list of songs. For learning and honing my skills in creating/managing databases I had completed multiple courses about the creation and manipulation of databases and how programs can interact with them to manage data, which are critical skills to have as many real-world applications that require data use databases to store/manage said data. Through these courses, I created both SQL and non-SQL (namely MongoDB) databases and developed applications and API that connected to the database and managed them using the four CRUD principles to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data entries. Finally, I learned and honed the basic skills of software security through taking multiple courses about identifying and documenting vulnerabilities within programs, patching flaws within code that could be a vulnerability and/or be exploited, and securing code and sensitive data from being stolen and/or accessed by an unauthorized individual. To identify and patch flaws and vulnerabilities, I utilized static analysis tools in addition to reviewing multiple secure coding standards (such as CERT C/C++ coding standards) against questionable code to find exploitable code and implement solutions to prevent the code from being exploitable anymore. Core security concepts such as triple A (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) and hash encryption were also learned and used through these security courses to manage and monitor access to certain systems/components while ensuring that sensitive data such as user passwords are not stored in a raw format within a database, to prevent said data from being easily read if it does get stolen or accessed by an unauthorized user.

                 This portfolio is the cumulative effort of the most important courses I have taken throughout this program to demonstrate my proficient skills in software development. There are two artifacts here that have been created and enhanced to showcase my skills in three different categories: software engineering, data structures and algorithms, and databases. The first artifact is a full stack web application written in JavaScript that acts as a dashboard to display and manage a database of sheltered animals in the Austin Texas area, which includes filtering features to find specific dogs suitable for rescue jobs or adoption, a map to dynamically display the location of an animal, a pie chart to show the different types and counts of each breed of animal, administrative controls to utilize CRUD functions to manage the database, and basic security to allow administrators to log into the application and ensure that only they can use the CRUD functions. The application was originally a simple program written in Python, but was recreated as a full stack website to provide further functionality to a wider audience looking to find animals to adopt. This application showcases my skills in developing a functional and efficient server and client side for an application, understanding and replicating an original program into a different programming language, and creating effective solutions to allow for client side and server side components to interact with each other to form a functional website. This application also showcases my skills in developing and managing a No-SQL database with the core CRUD principles in addition to developing security protocols to properly allow/deny access to important functions, which in this case would be the functions that modify the database in any way. The second artifact is a mobile application written in Java for android devices to manage the inventory of a warehouse or store, allowing for users to view the items they have in stock and the remaining quantity of each item as well as increasing or decreasing said quantity whenever they receive or sell an item. This application was enhanced with a filtering feature that utilized high performance sorting algorithms to very efficiently sort through a list of 100,000 items to find any items that are close to being out of stock (among other filtering options) in addition to plenty of fixes and implementation of error handling to prevent undefined behavior or unexpected crashes from happening. This application showcases my skills in understanding various sorting algorithms and their respective time complexities, implementing complex algorithms to improve performance of an application, and in proper error handling to prevent undefined behavior or potential exploits from occurring.

                <p class="paragraph">For this first enhancement, I have recreated the core functionality of previous project into a JavaScript/TypeScript full-stack application. The original artifact, the Graziosos Salvare Animal Shelter Dashboard, was a Python written program to display a collection of animals from different animal shelters in the Austin Texas area, in which animals could be filtered through based on their candidacy for certain rescue animal operations. This artifact was created over a year ago, and included a data table that displayed a list of all animals (or certain animals if a filter was selected) within a database, a map component that displayed the location of an animal selected on the data table, and a pie chart to list the count of each breed shown in the data table. This artifact also included server-side CRUD functionalities to create, read, update, and delete entries from the connected database, however, only the read function was used in the client-side dashboard. All of these features (except for the filtering, which was implemented in the third enhancement) have been introduced into the enhanced application to replicate the original functionality of the artifact.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">I selected this item to be enhanced and put into my ePortfolio as while it did fulfill its purpose at the time it was created, I believed that it was very basic, and it had the potential to be a more universal shelter dashboard that could be used by a wider audience of users that were looking for suitable animals to adopt in addition to the more niche (yet still very important) audience of rescue animal trainers. Additionally, I wanted to demonstrate my skills in being able to replicate a program in a different language (in this case, from Python to JavaScript), which in turn would demonstrate my skills in writing JavaScript and in understanding both Python and JavaScript so I could replicate the core functionalities. These skills were showcased in the JavaScript code I made to connect to and manipulate a database with the basic CRUD principles and in the multiple angular components I created for the front-end that each replicate a certain component from the original artifact. These concepts from this artifact were improved upon by separating the different components into individual modules, such that they are no longer in just two files, making the code better organized and making each component easier to maintain without necessarily affecting other components. This artifact was also further improved upon with updated comments and improved error handling to allow code to be further maintainable while preventing simple user mistakes (such as forgetting to include all required fields for a data entry) from causing the application to stop abruptly.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">The two core outcomes I had planned to meet with this enhancement were outcomes 4 and 5. From the enhancements I have performed, I have exceptionally fulfilled the 4th outcome as I have utilized my skills learned from previous courses and external tools I have researched to produce a full-stack program in a different language that replicates the core features and functionality of the original program. However, as the front-end does not manipulate the connected database besides from simply reading entries (there was no direct front-end database manipulation in the original artifact either), I did not put much focus into data security besides from error handling to prevent unexpected app terminations, so I would not say I completely fulfilled the 5th outcome from this first enhancement. Though as I returned to this artifact for the third enhancement, which I implemented improved database features that includes incorporating security, I was able to fulfill the 5th outcome there.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">The process to enhance this artifact came with plenty of challenges, and I have learned quite a bit throughout this process. As I had to rebuild this artifact into a different language, including creating a new database to be able to store and manage data, this process involved me creating an API that implemented the CRUD component to allow for a database to be connected and controlled via different API calls. After having the server-side component remade, I had to create the client-side services and components to interact with the database API calls and to display the different features that were implemented in the original project. This is where the majority of the challenges and learning occurred, as not only did I need to find tools/libraries necessary to replicate each component, but I needed to figure out how to connect them with the data they needed so they could be functional and dynamic. With some research and experimentation, I was able to learn about different JavaScript tools that function almost the same as the tools used in the original project in addition to how these tools can be set up and programmed to be able to properly receive and manipulate data to be displayed in the same way they were before. By understanding how to properly implement and utilize these tools for my purposes, I was able to create a successor program that replicated the functionality and features of the original artifact.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="paragraph">For my second enhancement, I have improved upon a mobile application I had made previously by implementing advanced filtering options to very efficiently sort through a set of 100,000 data entries in addition to various improvements of existing features to enhance the overall efficiency of the application. Created in early 2024, this artifact is an inventory management application designed with the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) principle in mind to display a database of items in stock within a given warehouse or store, allowing for users (employees of the store/warehouse) to add and remove items from the app in addition to updating the quantity of items to accurately represent the inventory stock. The original artifact also included a basic search feature and notification feature to allow for users to find specific products and get notified when items run out of stock, however these features were implemented poorly and either didn’t work as they were intended to or not at all.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">I chose to enhance this artifact and include it in my ePortfolio as while it did serve its basic purpose of displaying items for users to look through and manage, it was painfully inefficient to find items that were going close to being out of stock, especially if there were thousands or tens of thousands of different items within the database, which would make this application pointless in managing an inventory if you can even find the items going out of stock. Additionally, this artifact was the first big and (nearly) fully functional project that I had made in this program, which had plenty of issues that needed to be fixed, and I wanted to demonstrate my skills both in creating a mobile application such as this and in cleaning up and fixing issues to produce an even more polished and functioning application that can be better understood and maintained than the original. I have improved upon this application by including a filter option to sort data based on its name alphabetically and its remaining quantity (both low-high and high-low). With this filter option, I implemented three different sorting algorithms of various efficiencies and complexities (bubble sort, merge sort, and heap sort) to demonstrate different ways data can be sorted, and have documented each algorithm to explain their time complexities and their efficiencies (or inefficiencies) in sorting through very large sets of data. These improvements showcase my skills in understanding various common and complex sorting algorithms and their efficiencies/roles in sorting data of different sizes, and also in writing said algorithms to quickly sort data without using a database or external methods to do so. I have further improved this application by cleaning up functions, implementing security procedures for user inputs, and including error handling for uncaught exceptions, showcasing my skills in preventing unexpected crashes/behavior from occurring or data from being stolen (primarily via SQL injections) while still improving the overall functionality of this application.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">From the work I have did for this enhancement, I have met core outcome 3, which I had planned to meet with this enhancement from the start, and I have additionally slightly met outcome 5 as well. I have met outcome 3 as I have developed 3 different solutions in the form of algorithms of various efficiencies and complexities to sort data in 3 separate ways for better organization of data and to allow for easy identification of items close to getting out of stock. I have also partially completed outcome 5 as I have implemented simple security measures to prevent special characters in user input that may represent parts of commands/SQL injections from being processed by the database and have included more checks to prevent common exceptions such as integer overflows from occurring that could cause unexpected or undefined behavior within the application.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">Throughout the process of this enhancement, I have learned quite a lot and have encountered and overcame a few challenges. One thing I have learned is the importance of organizing your code and implementing proper comments to ensure code is easier to maintain in the future, as certain code sections I had written before did not contain comments. I had to struggle a bit with figuring out what they did as I did not completely remember what each piece was doing, through fortunately most of the code was already organized neatly so I was eventually able to understand what each piece did and what needed to be changed so my enhancements could be used in this application. The biggest thing I have learned was the importance of implementing and utilizing the right data structures to efficiently handle the data you need. There are many different sorting algorithms that can be used to sort data in the same way, though they all have their own complexity to them and handle data at different speeds. Bubble sort, for example, is a very simple algorithm that was pretty easy to implement as it mainly uses two nested loops to swap data around until it is sorted, however it can take a very long time (relative to how fast computer processes usually take) to sort through a large set of data, with it taking over 3 minutes to sort through 100,000 data entries. Heap sort, on the other hand, is a much more complicated algorithm that was challenging to implement as it utilizes recursion and the concept of binary trees to sort data, but is vastly more efficient in sorting large sets of data, as it took barely a fraction of a second to correctly sort the 100,000 data entries. Based on these examples, it is always important to understand the data and the amount of data you have or will potentially have so you can choose the most appropriate algorithm to use.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="paragraph">For the third enhancement, I have continued to improve upon the functionality and security of my project made for enhancement one, the recreated Graziosos Salvare Animal Shelter Dashboard, by implementing back and front end components and methods to manipulate and control a database based on the core CRUD principles without ever needing to directly access the database. The original artifact for this project was a program written in Python in early 2024 that managed a pre-built database to display data about sheltered animals around the Austin Texas area, allowing users to select and view the location of animals as well as search for dogs that are suitable for multiple types of rescue training. This artifact was initially enhanced for the first enhancement, where it was rewritten into a full stack application using JavaScript, to display a list of sheltered animals. However, this initial enhancement did not include any functions to filter through the database nor did it have any components on the dashboard that allowed for the database to be manipulated besides from simply displaying data, requiring any changes that wanted to be made to the data to be made either directly through the database using command lines or tools such as MongoDB Compass or through direct API calls using tools like Postman.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">I chose to further enhance this project in enhancement three as while the initial enhancement recreated the basic functions of the original artifact to neatly display a table of sheltered animals, there was no further functionality, essentially making it a static web page that only displayed the data it was given and prevented the data from being easily changed. This project had much more potential than just a simple tool to display sheltered animal, and I wanted to fulfill this potential by introducing add, edit, and delete features in addition to security features to allow this application to be used by theoretical administrators of the Graziosos Salvare team to securely manage the data within this application on the application itself, preventing the need to directly access the back-end to do so. To improve upon this project and to further fulfill its potential, I implemented the last three features of the CRUD functionality (create, update, and delete) by creating new components to dynamically add. remove, and update animal entries all in one page. To make sure these features are secure to prevent guests/non admins from modifying the database, I implemented a login feature along with authentication security components in the front and back ends to authenticate admins and ensure that only admin users with valid credentials and a valid JSON Web Token can view and access these CRUD features. Additionally, I have implemented a custom filtering feature to allow users to find animals that are not only candidates for rescue training but are available for adoption, allowing for the application to be used in a more universal manner to view animals that are available to be adopted in various shelters in Austin. I also have implemented plenty of minor features such as a selection display to make the application look more responsive and better seeding to allow for a more realistic display of the many different potential animals in Austin shelters. With these improvements, I demonstrate my skills in creating core database features to manage/control a database based on my implementations of the remaining CRUD features, and in understanding and implementing basic security with the login and authentication functions to prevent unknown users from being able to change the database. I also demonstrate my skills in being able to implement interactions between a server and a client based on my implementations of the CRUD and security features as well, as both sides need to interact with the other end to allow requests to be verified and processed.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">The two core outcomes that I had planned to meet for this enhancement were outcomes 4 and 5. Based on the improvements I have made for this third enhancement, I have fulfilled these two outcomes. Outcome 4 was fulfilled by utilizing my skills and knowledge on the CRUD principles and the given software environment to develop the front end components to add, update, and remove data from the database, while Outcome 5 was fulfilled by my understanding of basic security principles to implement a functional administrator login feature to allow administrators to be authenticated to use the add, update, and remove features.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">This process of improving the project came with a few challenges, and I have learned quite a bit by facing and overcoming these challenges. One thing I learned was the importance of understanding the tools or libraries you use so you can write a solution for it to make it work the way you want it to. During the implementation of the custom filtering for example, I needed to update the data table so it correctly displayed the new filtered data queried from the database, but inserting the data and attempting to display it would only display the original set of data. This was due to the data table library I was using being static, such that no data could be added or changed after implementation. By understanding this, I was able to implement a solution that saved the filtering data into storage and reimplemented the data table whenever a new filter was selected to allow for the new data to be correctly displayed on the dashboard. Another thing I learned was the importance of including security not only in the front end to hide or show features, but also in the back end to control the use of important functions that may change data. While simply hiding features from users can help prevent non authorized users from seeing sensitive functions, they can still be accessed in other ways such as by entering the correct URL extension to route to a component. To ensure that sensitive functions are secure, it is critical to add security to the server side or onto any APIs to check all requests for validity and prevent any requests or processes that were not made by a valid or authenticated user. By better understanding these concepts, I can further improve on my problem solving skills and understand even more advanced concepts of security to make the projects and databases I program now and in the future more functional and secure.</p>
